-Efficient transportation is essential for college campuses, yet the absence of a real-time system often leads to uncertainty and inconvenience for students. This project aims to bridge this gap by providing a user-friendly web application that enables live tracking of college buses.
Developed using Flutter, the application ensures a seamless and responsive user experience across devices. Firebase is integrated as the backend, efficiently managing real-time database updates, user authentication, and data synchronization. OpenStreetMap’s API enables accurate location tracking and an interactive map interface, allowing users to monitor the bus’s live position in real time.
-GPS technology is a hardware component that fetches precise real-time location data, ensuring accurate and reliable tracking. This combination of technologies enhances the efficiency and convenience of college transportation.
